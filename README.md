# Exploring OSRM, OSMnx, and Google Maps Directions API for finding routes between a set of origin-destination pairs.

In [this notebook](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/spatial-routing-libraries-and-services/blob/main/Routing_Libraries_Services.ipynb), I explore three of the routing libraries for calculating routes for a set of origin and destination pairs, along with information such as travel distances and travel times along these routes. Based on your use case, you can pick which one works best for you. Also check out each of their documentation pages to know about more options for each.
