# Exploring OSRM, OSMnx, and Google Maps Directions API using python for finding routes between a set of origin-destination pairs.

In [this notebook](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/spatial-routing-libraries-and-services/blob/main/Routing_Libraries_Services.ipynb), I explore three routing libraries for calculating fastest, shortest, and traffic-based 'most efficient' travel routes for a set of origin and destination pairs, along with information such as travel distances and travel times along these routes. And then exporting a shapefile/GeoJSON of these routes along with the route attributes (duration and length/distance). Based on your use case, you can pick which one works best for you. Some other routing services that you can also explore, not discussed in this notebook, are TomTom Routing Engine and Mapbox Directions API.
