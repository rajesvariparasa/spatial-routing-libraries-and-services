# Exploring OSRM, OSMnx, and Google Maps Directions API for finding routes between a set of origin-destination pairs.

In [this notebook](https://github.com/rajesvariparasa/spatial-routing-libraries-and-services/blob/main/Routing_Libraries_Services.ipynb), I explore three routing libraries for calculating travel routes for a set of origin and destination pairs, along with information such as travel distances and travel times along these routes, and finally exporting a shapefile/GeoJSON of these routes along with the route attributes. Based on your use case, you can pick which one works best for you. Some other routing services that you can also explore, not discussed in the notebook, are TomTom Routing Engine and Mapbox Directions API.
